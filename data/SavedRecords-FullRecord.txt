Study design: Randomized controlled experimental study. Animals: Eighteen purpose-bred sexually mature hound dogs. Methods: Tibial osteotomies were performed, and dogs were divided into three groups: no carprofen (n=6), 2-week administration of carprofen at 2.2 mg/kg twice daily (n=6), and 8-week administration of carprofen at 2.2 mg/kg twice daily (n=5). Bone healing was evaluated radiographically at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively. Postmortem, fracture healing was assessed via biomechanical testing (three-point bending), histological cartilage:callus ratio, and bone mineral density (BMD) with quantitative computed tomography. Results: No biomechanical difference was detected between dogs that received no carprofen and those that received 2 weeks of carprofen or between those that received 2 weeks vs 8 weeks of carprofen. Stiffness (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.035) and maximum stress (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.042) were higher in dogs that received no carprofen than in those that received 8 weeks of carprofen. Radiographic healing did not differ between dogs without carprofen and those with 2-week administration of carprofen (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.9923). However, tibias of dogs without carprofen and those with 2-week administration of carprofen were more healed compared with those in the 8-week-carprofen group at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.0011). No treatment effect was detected by cartilage:callus ratio or BMD. Conclusion: Long-term administration of carprofen had a negative effect on bone healing compared with short-term or no administration of carprofen. Clinical significance: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously in dogs at risk for delayed bone healing, and administration should be discontinued beyond the perioperative period in dogs with fractures or osteotomies.

20193093925	Journal article	The analgesic effects of buprenorphine (Vetergesic or Simbadol) in combination with carprofen in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy: a randomized, blinded, clinical trial.			Watanabe, R.; Monteiro, B. P.; Evangelista, M. C.; Castonguay, A.; Edge, D.; Steagall, P. V.			BMC Veterinary Research		1746-6148	14	304	(5 October 2018)	10.1186/s12917-018-1628-4	BioMed Central Ltd		2018	London	UK	English		Background: Buprenorphine is a potent lipophilic opioid analgesic that is largely used in the multimodal treatment of acute pain. Simbadol (buprenorphine hydrochloride) is the first and only FDA-approved high-concentration formulation of buprenorphine for use in cats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of carprofen in combination with one of two commercial formulations of buprenorphine (Simbadol and Vetergesic, 1.8 mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL, respectively) in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Twenty-four dogs were included in a randomized, prospective, controlled, clinical trial. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups as follows. Dogs were premedicated with acepromazine (0.02 mg/kg) and either 0.02 mg/kg of Vetergesic or Simbadol intramuscularly (Vetergesic group - VG; Simbadol group - SG, respectively; <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</i>=12/group). General anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Carprofen (4.4 mg/kg SC) was administered after induction of anesthesia. Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry, pain scores using the Glasgow Composite Pain Scale Short Form (CMPS-SF), sedation scores using a dynamic interactive visual analogue scale and adverse events were evaluated before and after ovariohysterectomy by an observer who was unaware of treatment administration. If CMPS-SF scores were ≥5/20, dogs were administered rescue analgesia (morphine 0.5 mg/kg IM). Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models and Fisher's exact test (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">p</i>&lt;0.05). Results: Pain and sedation scores and physiological parameters were not significantly different between treatments. Three dogs in VG (25%) and none in SG (0%) required rescue analgesia (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">p</i>=0.109). Adverse effects (i.e. vomiting and melena) were observed in two dogs in SG and were thought to be related to stress and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity. Conclusions: The administration of buprenorphine with carprofen preoperatively provided adequate postoperative analgesia for the majority of dogs undergoing OVH without serious adverse events. Prevalence of rescue analgesia was not significantly different between groups; however, it could be clinically relevant and explained by a type II error (i.e. small sample size). Future studies are necessary to determine if analgesic efficacy after Simbadol and Vetergesic is related to individual variability or pharmacokinetic differences.

20123105136	Journal article	Robenacoxib vs. carprofen for the treatment of canine osteoarthritis; a randomized, noninferiority clinical trial.			Reymond, N.; Speranza, C.; Gruet, P.; Seewald, W.; King, J. N.			Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics		0140-7783	35	2	175-183	10.1111/j.1365-2885.2011.01297.x	Wiley-Blackwell		2012	Oxford	UK	English		Robenacoxib is a member of the coxib class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), with high selectivity for the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 isoform of COX. In this study, the efficacy and tolerability of robenacoxib were compared with those of carprofen in canine osteoarthritis in a multi-centre, prospective, randomized, blinded, positive-controlled noninferiority clinical trial. Both drugs were administered orally once daily at recommended dosages: robenacoxib at 1-2 mg/kg (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</i>=125 dogs) and racemic carprofen at 2-4 mg/kg (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</i>=63 dogs) for a total of 12 weeks. The efficacy of the test compounds was assessed by veterinary investigators and owners using numerical rating scales at baseline and days 7, 14, 28, 56 and 84. In both groups, all scores were significantly (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>&lt;0.0001) improved compared with baseline at all time points (days 7-84). Robenacoxib had noninferior efficacy to carprofen for the primary endpoint, the global functional disability, both for all dogs and for the subgroup of dogs in which robenacoxib was not administered during meals. Noninferiority was also demonstrated for three of six veterinary investigator secondary endpoints and four of six owner efficacy endpoints. For haematology and clinical chemistry variables, there were some significant differences from baseline levels but no differences between groups. There were no differences between groups in the frequencies of adverse events, which were reported in 46% dogs with robenacoxib and 52% with carprofen (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=0.44), which were most frequently mild events affecting the gastrointestinal tract. In conclusion, noninferior efficacy and tolerability of robenacoxib compared with carprofen was demonstrated in dogs with osteoarthritis.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled clinical study. ANIMALS: 54 HD-affected dogs and 16 healthy dogs. PROCEDURES: Seven HD-affected dogs were removed from the study. Dogs with HD were treated in a blinded manner for 30 days with acupuncture (once weekly for 5 sessions; n=15), carprofen (4.4 mg/kg [2.0 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h; n=16), or placebo capsules containing lactose (1 mg/kg [0.45 mg/lb], PO, q 24 h; n=16). Dogs were evaluated 2 weeks and immediately before (baseline) and 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the onset of treatment. Owners evaluated the dogs' pain intensity with 2 validated questionnaires and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and evaluated degree of lameness with a VAS for locomotion. Kinetics of the hind limbs were also evaluated. Sixteen HD-free dogs were used to assess the evaluation protocol. RESULTS: Owners' assessments revealed that outcomes of the 3 treatments did not differ significantly. The Canine Brief Pain Inventory and VAS pain intensity assessments were decreased from baseline at weeks 4 and 6, respectively, but only in acupuncture-treated dogs. The locomotion VAS values were decreased at week 4 in acupuncture-treated and carprofen-treated dogs. Kinetic evaluation findings did not differ among the groups or over time. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Neither acupuncture nor carprofen was significantly different from placebo. Acupuncture and carprofen reduced the degree of subjectively evaluated lameness, and acupuncture was associated with a decrease in validated chronic pain scores.

20183108092	Journal article	Lack of effectiveness of tramadol hydrochloride for the treatment of pain and joint dysfunction in dogs with chronic osteoarthritis.			Budsberg, S. C.; Torres, B. T.; Kleine, S. A.; Sandberg, G. S.; Berjeski, A. K.			Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association		0003-1488	252	4	427-432	10.2460/javma.252.4.427	American Veterinary Medical Association		2018	Schaumburg	USA	English		OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of tramadol for treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study. ANIMALS 40 dogs with clinical osteoarthritis of the elbow or stifle joint. PROCEDURES: Dogs orally received 3 times/d (morning, midday, and night) for a 10-day period each of 3 identically appearing treatments (placebo; carprofen at 2.2 mg/kg [1 mg/lb], q 12 h [morning and night], with placebo at midday; or tramadol hydrochloride at 5 mg/kg [2.3 mg/lb], q 8 h) in random order, with treatment sessions separated by a minimum 7-day washout period. Vertical ground reaction forces (vertical impulse [VI] and peak vertical force [PVF]) were measured and Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) scores assigned prior to (baseline) and at the end of each treatment period. Repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to compare VI and PVF data among and within treatments, and the χ<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup> test was used to compare proportions of dogs with a CBPI-defined positive response to treatment. RESULTS: 35 dogs completed the study. No significant changes from baseline in VI and PVF were identified for placebo and tramadol treatments; however, these values increased significantly with carprofen treatment. Changes from baseline in VI and PVF values were significantly greater with carprofen versus placebo or tramadol treatment. A significant improvement from baseline in CBPI scores was identified with carprofen treatment but not placebo or tramadol treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 10 days of treatment with tramadol as administered (5 mg/kg, PO, q 8 h) provided no clinical benefit for dogs with osteoarthritis of the elbow or stifle joint.

20173023657	Journal article	Effectiveness of disease modifying osteoarthritis agents and carprofen for treatment of canine osteoarthritis.			Kwananocha, I.; Vijarnsorn, M.; Kashemsant, N.; Lekcharoensuk, C.			Thai Journal of Veterinary Medicine		0125-6491	46	3	363-371		Faculty of Veterinary Science, Chulalongkorn University		2016	Bangkok	Thailand	English		A prospective, randomized, single-blinded study was conducted to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of disease modifying osteoarthritis agents (DMOAAs) and carprofen by using force plate gait analysis and orthopaedic assessment score (OAS) in osteoarthritic dogs. Forty dogs with hip and/or stifle osteoarthritis (OA) were assigned randomly into four treatment groups: PCSO-524, treated with a marine-based fatty-acid compound; GC-ASU, treated with a combination of glucosamine-chondroitin sulphate and avocado/soybean unsaponifiables; CPF, treated with carprofen; and CPF-PCSO, treated with a combination of carprofen and PCSO-524. Each group received the therapeutic agent orally for four weeks. Peak vertical force (PVF), OAS, haematology and blood chemistry values were evaluated before treatment, and on the second and fourth weeks post-treatment. No significant effect was found in the PVF, OAS and blood values among the four treatment groups. Analyses within groups revealed significant increase in PVF among the PCSO-524, CPF and CPF-PCSO groups (p&lt;0.05). OAS showed significant decrease in the PCSO-524, CPF and CPF-PCSO groups (p&lt;0.05). Average BUN in the CPF group increased significantly (p&lt;0.05). PVF negatively correlated with OAS with r=-0.39 (p=0.014), r=-0.49 (p=0.001) and r=-0.48 (p=0.002) before treatment and on the second and fourth weeks post-treatment, respectively. Even though increased PVFs were demonstrated within the PCSO-524, CPF and CPF-PCSO groups, the greatest improvement was demonstrated in the CPF-PCSO group. The preliminary results imply the clinical benefits of PCSO-524 in combination with carprofen in the treatment of OA.

20153031947	Journal article	Comparison of carprofen and tramadol for postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing enucleation.			Delgado, C.; Bentley, E.; Hetzel, S.; Smith, L. J.			Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association		0003-1488	245	12	1375-1381	10.2460/javma.245.12.1375	American Veterinary Medical Association		2014	Schaumburg	USA	English		Objective - To compare analgesia provided by carprofen and tramadol in dogs after enucleation. Design - Randomized, masked clinical trial. Animals - 43 dogs. Procedures - Client-owned dogs admitted for routine enucleation were randomly assigned to receive either carprofen or tramadol orally 2 hours prior to surgery and 12 hours after the first dose. Dogs were scored for signs of pain at baseline (ie, before carprofen or tramadol administration) and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, and 30 hours after extubation. Dogs received identical premedication and inhalation anesthesia regimens, including premedication with hydromorphone. If the total pain score was ≥9 (maximum possible score of 20), there was a score ≥3 in any of 5 behavioral categories (highest score possible per category was 3 or 4), or the visual analog scale (VAS) score was ≥35 (maximum possible score of 100) combined with a palpation score &gt;0, rescue analgesia (hydromorphone) was administered and treatment failure was recorded. Results - No differences were found in age, sex, or baseline pain scores between groups. Significantly more dogs receiving tramadol required rescue analgesia (6/21), compared with dogs receiving carprofen (1/22). Pain and VAS scores decreased linearly over time. No significant differences were found in pain or VAS scores between groups at any time point (dogs were excluded from analysis after rescue). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Results of this study suggested that carprofen, with opioid premedication, may provide more effective postoperative analgesia than tramadol in dogs undergoing enucleation.

20203233709	Journal article	Pharmacokinetics and analgesic effects of intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous buprenorphine in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy: a randomized, prospective, masked, clinical trial.			Steagall, P. V.; Ruel, H. L. M.; Yasuda, T.; Monteiro, B. P.; Watanabe, R.; Evangelista, M. C.; Beaudry, F.			BMC Veterinary Research		1746-6148	16	154	(24 May 2020)	10.1186/s12917-020-02364-w	BioMed Central Ltd		2020	London	UK	English		Background: Buprenorphine is used for canine postoperative pain management. This study aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics and evaluate the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine (Simbadol, 1.8 mg/mL) administered by different routes in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Twenty-four dogs were included in a randomized, prospective, masked, clinical trial. Buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg) was administered intravenously (IV), intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</i> = 8/group) 0.5 h before general anesthesia with propofol-isoflurane. Carprofen (4.4 mg/kg SC) was administered after anesthetic induction and before ovariohysterectomy. Pain was scored using the short-form Glasgow composite pain scale for dogs (SF-GCPS). Dogs were administered morphine (0.25 mg/kg IV) when SF-GCPS scores were ≥ 5/20. Blood sampling was performed up to 720 min after drug administration. Plasma buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine concentrations were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine was described using a non-compartmental model (PK Solver 2.0). Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models and Fisher's exact test (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">p</i> &lt; 0.05). Results: Pain scores were significantly higher than baseline after IV (0.5-2 h), IM (0.5-3 h) and SC (0.5-4 h) but not among groups. Prevalence of rescue analgesia was significantly higher in SC (7/8 dogs) than IV (2/8) but not different between IV and IM (3/8) or IM and SC. The frequency of rescue analgesia was not significantly different among groups (IV = 2, IM = 5 and SC = 9). Norbuprenorphine was not detected. For IV, IM and SC administration, clearance was 1.29, 1.65 and 1.40 L/hour/kg, volume of distribution was 6.8, 14.2 and 40.1 L/kg, the elimination half-life was 3.7, 5.7, 22 h, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curved extrapolated to infinity was 15.7, 12.4 and 16.4 ng/mL/hour, respectively. Bioavailability for IM and SC was 62.6 and 40%, respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations of buprenorphine were 6.2 and 1.3 ng/mL at 0.14 and 0.33 h after IM and SC administration, respectively. Conclusions: The route of administration influences the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine in dogs. SC administration of buprenorphine failed to provide clinical analgesia due to erratic drug absorption. At the doses administered, the IV and IM routes are preferred for postoperative analgesia.

Study design: Experimental, randomized, blinded study. Animals: Fifteen working police dogs with chronic back pain. Methods: Animals were divided randomly into control (CG; <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</i>=5) and treatment groups (TG; <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">n</i>=10). A combination of 140 mg lidocaine, 15 mg dexamethasone and 20 mg thiocolchicoside was administered to group TG along with a 70-day course of a placebo, administered as if it was carprofen. Carprofen was administered to Group CG for 70 days, at a dose adjusted to their weight. On day 0, an intradermal injection of Ringer's lactate was also administered. Both groups were rested for 3 days and resumed normal activity over a 5-day period. Response to treatment, measured by the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) and the Hudson Visual Analogue Scale (HVAS), was evaluated before treatment (T0), after 15 days (T1) and 1 (T2), 2 (T3), 3 (T4), 4 (T5) and 5 (T6) months. Results were compared using a Mann-Whitney test or a paired samples <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">t</i> test. Results: When comparing CBPI results, no differences were found between groups TG and CG at T0 through T3 and in T6 and T7. Differences were observed in CBPI sections after the discontinuation of carprofen: at T4 [<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">p</i>=0.02 for Pain Interference Score (PIS) and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">p</i>=0.03 for Pain Severity Score (PSS)] and T5 (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">p</i>=0.16 for PIS and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">p</i>=0.03 for PSS), with group TG having overall better results. Individual treatment results were considered successful in one dog of group CG (20%), whereas in group TG, success was higher (ranging from 78% at T1 to 22% at T7). No significant differences were registered with the HVAS. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Mesotherapy may be a promising treatment option for canine musculoskeletal-related pain.

20133044903	Journal article	Comparison of force plate gait analysis and owner assessment of pain using the canine brief pain inventory in dogs with osteoarthritis.			Brown, D. C.; Boston, R. C.; Farrar, J. T.			Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine		0891-6640	27	1	22-30	10.1111/jvim.12004	Wiley-Blackwell		2013	Boston	USA	English		Background: Lameness assessment using force plate gait analysis (FPGA) and owner assessment of chronic pain using the Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI) are valid and reliable methods of evaluating canine osteoarthritis. There are no studies comparing these 2 outcome measures. Objective: Evaluate the relationship between CBPI pain severity (PS) and interference (PI) scores with the vertical forces of FPGA as efficacy measures in canine osteoarthritis. Animals: Sixty-eight client-owned dogs with osteoarthritis (50 hind limb and 18 forelimb). Methods: Double-blind, randomized. Owners completed the CBPI, and dogs underwent FPGA on days 0 and 14. Dogs received carprofen or placebo on days 1 through 14. The change in PS and PI scores from day 0 to 14 were compared to the change in peak vertical force (PVF) and vertical impulse (VI). Results: PS and PI scores significantly decreased in carprofen - compared with placebo-treated dogs (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.002 and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.03, respectively). PVF and VI significantly increased in carprofen - compared with placebo-treated dogs (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.006 and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.02, respectively). There was no correlation or concordance between the PS or PI score changes and change in PVF or VI. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: In these dogs with hind limb or forelimb osteoarthritis, owner assessment of chronic pain using the CBPI and assessment of lameness using FPGA detected significant improvement in dogs treated with carprofen. The lack of correlation or concordance between the change in owner scores and vertical forces suggests that owners were focused on behaviors other than lameness when making efficacy evaluations in their dogs.

In a randomized, controlled, double-blinded study sixteen dogs with osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia were distributed into two groups: 25 IU BoNT/A (BoNT) or saline solution (Control) was administered IA in each affected joint. All dogs received oral supplements (90 days) and carprofen (15 days). The dogs were assessed by a veterinarian on five occasions and the owner completed an assessment form at the same time (baseline to 90 days). The data were analyzed using unpaired-t test, Fisher's exact test, analysis of variance and the Tukey's test (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>&lt;0.05). There were no differences between groups in the veterinarian and owner assessments. Lower scores were observed in both groups during 90 days after IA therapy in the owner assessments (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>&lt;0.001). Compared with baseline, the Vet score was lower from 15-90 days after IA injection in the BoNT group, and at 15 and 30 days in the Control group (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>&lt;0.001). Both treatments were safe and reduced the clinical signs associated with hip osteoarthritis. However, IA BoNT/A (25 IU) did not provide better pain relief than the control treatment.

Journal of Veterinary Dentistry		0898-7564	37	4	184-191	10.1177/0898756420986926	Sage Publications		2020	Thousand Oaks	USA	English		The early effectiveness of 5 analgesics was investigated after periodontal treatment. Dogs were assigned to 6 groups (n = 14 each). A prospective, randomized and blinded clinical study was performed. Before anesthesia was induced, butorphanol, morphine, carprofen and saline were administered. After induction, a maxillary and mandibular block was performed with lidocaine or bupivacaine. Painful periodontal therapies were performed. Two hours after the administration of analgesics and after anesthesia reversal, pain was scored using the Visual Analog Scale for pain (VAS) and the modified University of Melbourne Pain Score (UMPS). Blood glucose and cortisol levels were measured prior to analgesic administration and again 2 hours later. Rescue analgesia was provided when the VAS exceeded 50 mm or the UMPS exceeded 14 points. Rescue analgesia was required in one patient in the morphine group and one in the carprofen group. The VAS values were significantly lower in the butorphanol group compared to those of the saline group and in the bupivacaine group vs. those in the saline and lidocaine groups. Significantly lower UMPS values were obtained in the bupivacaine group compared to those in the saline, butorphanol and lidocaine groups and in the carprofen group vs. those in the saline and lidocaine groups. Significantly higher serum cortisol values were found in the lidocaine group compared to those in the saline, bupivacaine and carprofen groups. Administration of carprofen or the use of nerve blocks with bupivacaine improved analgesia after periodontal treatment more than did butorphanol, morphine or nerve blocks using lidocaine.

20073244249	Journal article	Comparison of analgesic efficacy of preoperative or postoperative carprofen with or without preincisional mepivacaine epidural anesthesia in canine pelvic or femoral fracture repair.			Bergmann, H. M.; Nolte, I.; Kramer, S.			Veterinary Surgery		0161-3499	36	7	623-632	10.1111/j.1532-950X.2007.00314.x	Blackwell Publishing		2007	Boston	USA	English		Objective - To compare analgesic efficacy of preoperative versus postoperative administration of carprofen and to determine, if preincisional mepivacaine epidural anesthesia improves postoperative analgesia in dogs treated with carprofen. Study Design - Blind, randomized clinical study. Animals - Dogs with femoral (n=18) or pelvic (27) fractures. Methods - Dogs were grouped by restricted randomization into 4 groups: group 1=carprofen (4 mg/kg subcutaneously) immediately before induction of anesthesia, no epidural anesthesia; group 2=carprofen immediately after extubation, no epidural anesthesia; group 3=carprofen immediately before induction, mepivacaine epidural block 15 minutes before surgical incision; and group 4=mepivacaine epidural block 15 minutes before surgical incision, carprofen after extubation. All dogs were administered carprofen (4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, once daily) for 4 days after surgery. Physiologic variables, nociceptive threshold, lameness score, pain, and sedation (numerical rating scale [NRS], visual analog scale [VAS]), plasma glucose and cortisol concentration, renal function, and hemostatic variables were measured preoperatively and at various times after surgery. Dogs with VAS pain scores &gt;30 were administered rescue analgesia. Results - Group 3 and 4 dogs had significantly lower pain scores and amount of rescue analgesia compared with groups 1 and 2. VAS and NRS pain scores were not significantly different among groups 1 and 2 or among groups 3 and 4. There was no treatment effect on renal function and hemostatic variables. Conclusions - Preoperative carprofen combined with mepivacaine epidural anesthesia had superior postoperative analgesia compared with preoperative carprofen alone. When preoperative epidural anesthesia was performed, preoperative administration of carprofen did not improve postoperative analgesia compared with postoperative administration of carprofen. Clinical Relevance - Preoperative administration of systemic opioid agonists in combination with regional anesthesia and postoperative administration of carprofen provides safe and effective pain relieve in canine fracture repair.

Study Design: Double blind randomized placebo controlled trial. Animals: Dogs (n=80) with OA. Methods: Owners completed the COI on Day 0. Dogs were administered either carprofen or placebo on days 1 through 14. Owners completed the COI again on Day 14. The change in total instrument, stiffness, gait, function, and quality of life scores were assessed between groups. Results: Dogs administered carprofen had significant decreases in the total instrument score (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.002) as well as 3 of the 4 factor scores compared to dogs treated with placebo (stiffness score <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.015; gait score <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.001; and function score=0.008). The change in quality of life score was not significantly different between carprofen and placebo treated dogs (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=.124). Conclusions: The COI delivered the decreases in total instrument, stiffness, gait, and function scores that one would expect in dogs with OA treated with an NSAID compared with placebo administration. In this cohort of dogs, the quality of life score was not sensitive to the changes associated with NSAID administration.

A total of 32 dogs presenting with osteoarthritis were allocated randomly to receive, orally once daily for 28 days, either 1-2 mg/kg robenacoxib (n=21) or 3.5-5 mg/kg carprofen (n=11). Dogs were assessed by clinicians and owners using numerical rating scale scores at baseline and days 14 and 28. The primary efficacy endpoint was the global functional disability score, which was the sum of clinician scores for standing posture, lameness at walk, lameness at trot, willingness to raise the contralateral limb and pain at palpation. There was a good to excellent level of efficacy in both treatment groups. Differences between days 14 and 28 compared to day 0 were significant for all 11 clinician and owner scores for robenacoxib, and for 6 of 11 scores for carprofen. The efficacy of robenacoxib was numerically superior to carprofen for all 13 endpoints, but differences were not statistically significant. For the global functional disability score, the estimated efficacy of robenacoxib was 1.244 (95% confidence interval 0.555-2.493) relative to carprofen. The tolerability of both treatments was good as assessed from adverse events, clinical signs, and hematology and serum biochemistry variables. In conclusion, once daily administration of robenacoxib tablets had noninferior efficacy and tolerability compared to carprofen for the treatment of the clinical signs of osteoarthritis in dogs.

20123345368	Journal article	Effect of analgesic therapy on clinical outcome measures in a randomized controlled trial using client-owned dogs with hip osteoarthritis.			Malek, S.; Sample, S. J.; Schwartz, Z.; Nemke, B.; Jacobson, P. B.; Cozzi, E. M.; Schaefer, S. L.; Bleedorn, J. A.; Holzman, G.; Muir, P.			BMC Veterinary Research		1746-6148	8	185	(4 October 2012)		BioMed Central Ltd		2012	London	UK	English		Background: Pain and impaired mobility because of osteoarthritis (OA) is common in dogs and humans. Efficacy studies of analgesic drug treatment of dogs with naturally occurring OA may be challenging, as a caregiver placebo effect is typically evident. However, little is known about effect sizes of common outcome-measures in canine clinical trials evaluating treatment of OA pain. Forty-nine client-owned dogs with hip OA were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled prospective trial. After a 1 week baseline period, dogs were randomly assigned to a treatment (ABT-116 - transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) antagonist, Carprofen - non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Tramadol - opiate, or Placebo) for 2 weeks. Outcome-measures included physical examination parameters, owner questionnaire, activity monitoring, gait analysis, and use of rescue medication. Results: Acute hyperthermia developed after ABT-116 treatment (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>&lt;0.001). Treatment with carprofen (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>≤0.01) and tramadol (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>≤0.001) led to improved mobility assessed by owner questionnaire. Nighttime activity was increased after ABT-116 treatment (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>=0.01). Kinetic gait analysis did not reveal significant treatment effects. Use of rescue treatment decreased with treatment in the ABT-116 and Carprofen groups (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>&lt;0.001). Questionnaire score and activity count at the end of treatment were correlated with age, clinical severity at trial entry, and outcome measure baseline status (S<sub xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">R</sub>≥±0.40, <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>≤0.005). Placebo treatment effects were evident with all variables studied. Conclusion: Treatment of hip OA in client-owned dogs is associated with a placebo effect for all variables that are commonly used for efficacy studies of analgesic drugs. This likely reflects caregiver bias or the phenomenon of regression to the mean. In the present study, outcome measures with significant effects also varied between groups, highlighting the value of using multiple outcome measures, as well as an a priori analysis of effect size associated with each measure. Effect size data from the present study could be used to inform design of future trials studying analgesic treatment of canine OA. Our results suggest that analgesic treatment with ABT-116 is not as effective as carprofen or tramadol for treatment of hip arthritis pain in client-owned dogs.

W.; Poppenga, R. H.; Jutkowitz, L. A.			Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care		1479-3261	25	5	606-610	10.1111/vec.12305	Wiley-Blackwell		2015	Oxford	UK	English		Objective: To compare the effectiveness of single dose activated charcoal, single dose activated charcoal with sorbitol, and multidose activated charcoal in reducing plasma carprofen concentrations following experimental overdose in dogs. Design: Randomized, four period cross-over study. Setting: University research setting. Animals: Eight healthy Beagles. Interventions: A 120 mg/kg of carprofen was administered orally to each dog followed by either (i) a single 2 g/kg activated charcoal administration 1 hour following carprofen ingestion (AC); (ii) 2 g/kg activated charcoal with 3.84 g/kg sorbitol 1 hour following carprofen ingestion (ACS); (iii) 2 g/kg activated charcoal 1 hour after carprofen ingestion and repeated every 6 hours for a total of 4 doses (MD); (iv) no treatment (control). Measurements and Main Results: Plasma carprofen concentrations were obtained over a 36-hour period following carprofen ingestion for each protocol. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed and time versus concentration, area under the curve, maximum plasma concentration, time to maximum concentration, and elimination half-life were calculated and compared among the groups using ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Activated charcoal, activated charcoal with sorbitol (ACS), and multiple-dose activated charcoal (MD) significantly reduced the area under the curve compared to the control group. AC and MD significantly reduced the maximum concentration when compared to the control group. MD significantly reduced elimination half-life when compared to ACS and the control group. There were no other significant differences among the treatment groups. Conclusions: Activated charcoal and ACS are as effective as MD in reducing serum carprofen concentrations following experimental overdose in dogs. Prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of AC, ACS, and MD in the clinical setting.

Veterinary Record		0042-4900	176	11	284	10.1136/vr.102397	BMJ Publishing Group		2015	London	UK	English		A multi-site, masked, randomised parallel group study employing a double dummy treatment design was performed in canine veterinary patients to determine the comparative efficacy and safety of mavacoxib and carprofen in the treatment of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis for a period of 134 days. Treatments were administered according to their respective summaries of product characteristics. Of 139 dogs screened, 124 were suitable for study participation: 62 of which were dosed with mavacoxib and 62 with carprofen. Both treatments resulted in a very similar pattern of considerable improvement as indicated in all parameters assessed by both owner and veterinarian. The primary efficacy endpoint 'overall improvement' was a composite score of owner assessments after approximately six weeks of treatment. Both drugs were remarkably effective, with 57/61 (93.4 per cent) of mavacoxib-treated dogs and 49/55 (89.1 per cent) of carprofen-treated dogs demonstrating overall improvement and with mavacoxib's efficacy being non-inferior to carprofen. The treatments had a similar safety profile as evidenced by documented adverse events and summaries of clinical pathology parameters. The positive clinical response to treatment along with the safety and dosing regimen of mavacoxib makes it an attractive therapy for canine osteoarthritis.

Carprofen was administered subcutaneously 30 min before anaesthesia, bupivacaine was administered by nerve blocks in anaesthetized dogs. Painful periodontal treatment was performed in all patients, lasting up to one hour. Modified University of Melbourne Pain Score (UMPS), Visual Analogue Scale for pain assessment (VAS), plasma glucose and serum cortisol levels were assessed 30 min before administration of analgesics (C-0, B-0, CB-0) and 2 h after recovery from anaesthesia (C-2, B-2, CB-2). For statistical analysis Friedman test, Mann-Whitney U-test, ANOVA and Fischer exact tests were used (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i>&lt;0.05). In CB-2 compared to CB-0 significantly decreased modified UMPS values. In CB-2 UMPS values were significantly lower compared to C-2 or B-2. In C-2 VAS values were significantly increased compared to C-0, and in B-2 VAS values were significantly increased compared to B-0. Visual Analogue Scale values were significantly lower in CB-2 compared to C-2 or B-2. Significantly increased plasma glucose concentrations were found in C-2 compared to C-0 and in B-2 compared to B-0. No other significant differences were detected. Administration of carprofen, bupivacaine or their combination is sufficient for early postoperative analgesia following periodontal treatment. Carprofen-bupivacaine combination is superior to carprofen or bupivacaine administered separately.

A secondary aim was to assess the effects in kittens and pregnant animals. Buprenorphine 180 µg/m<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup> or butorphanol 6 mg/m<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2</sup> were given with either carprofen 4 mg/kg (groups BUPC and BUTC, respectively) or meloxicam 0.3 mg/kg (groups BUPM or BUTM, respectively). Medetomidine was not antagonised. A simple, descriptive scale (SDS; 0-4), a dynamic and interactive visual analogue scale (DIVAS; 0-100 mm) and mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MT; 2.5-mm diameter probe) were used to evaluate postoperative pain.

DESIGN: Randomized, blinded controlled trial. ANIMALS: 40 healthy shelter-owned female dogs admitted to a student surgery program for ovariohysterectomy. PROCEDURES: Dogs were randomly assigned to receive after ovariohysterectomy a 5-cm-wide strip of TLP applied topically on both sides of the incision, for the full length of the incision and a wound dressing (n=19) or a placebo patch (nonmedicated wound dressing; 21). All dogs underwent midline ovariohysterectomy. Immediately afterward, dogs received 2 IM morphine injections, carprofen (SC, q 12 h for 2 days), and the assigned patch (left in place for 18 hours). Postoperative comfort was evaluated by use of the short form of the Glasgow Composite Measures Pain Scale and serum cortisol concentrations measured prior to premedication and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 18 hours after surgery. RESULTS: No significant difference in pain scores or serum cortisol concentrations was identified between dogs that received the TLP and dogs that received a placebo patch after ovariohysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The TLP provided no additional analgesic benefit to dogs treated concurrently with recommended doses of morphine and carprofen following ovariohysterectomy. Additional studies are needed to investigate whether similar results might be achieved in dogs treated concurrently with other analgesics.

Design - Randomized, controlled, multisite clinical trial. Animals - 131 client-owned dogs with stable chronic osteoarthritis examined at 33 privately owned veterinary hospitals in the United States. Procedures - In all dogs, the dosage of carprofen was standardized over a 3-week period to approximately 4.4 mg/kg/d (2 mg/lb/d), PO. Dogs were then randomly assigned to receive a food supplemented with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids or a control food with low omega-3 fatty acid content, and 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks later, investigators made decisions regarding increasing or decreasing the carprofen dosage on the basis of investigator assessments of 5 clinical signs and owner assessments of 15 signs. Results - Linear regression analysis indicated that over the 12-week study period, carprofen dosage decreased significantly faster among dogs fed the supplemented diet than among dogs fed the control diet. The distribution of changes in carprofen dosage for dogs in the control group was significantly different from the distribution of changes in carprofen dosage for dogs in the test group. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Results suggested that in dogs with chronic osteoarthritis receiving carprofen because of signs of pain, feeding a diet supplemented with fish oil omega-3 fatty acids may allow for a reduction in carprofen dosage.

Veterinary Surgery		0161-3499	27	6	568-582	10.1111/j.1532-950X.1998.tb00533.x			1998			English		The timing of carprofen administration on the severity of postoperative pain was investigated in 40 adult bitches (10-25 kg) undergoing ovariohysterectomy in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. The pharmacokinetics of carprofen was studied in 22 bitches under these conditions. The dogs were examined at 20 h after surgery using subjective visual assessment scoring systems (DIVAS) and objective mechanical nociceptive threshold measurements. 40 dogs were assigned to one of 3 groups: (1) preoperative carprofen; (2) postoperative carprofen; and (3) no analgesics (saline injections). The dose of carprofen was 4.0 mg/kg s.c. The dogs given carprofen preoperatively had lower pain scores than the other groups, significantly so at 2 h after extubation (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i> &lt; 0.01 and <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i> &lt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Dunn's). Mechanical pain thresholds measured at the distal tibia showed the development of hyperalgesia at 12 and 20 h after extubation; this was prevented by both the preoperative (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i> &lt; 0.05 at 12 and 20 h, Kruskal-Wallis) and postoperative (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i> &lt; 0.05 at 20 h, Kruskal-Wallis) administration of carprofen. Mechanical pain threshold testing at the wound showed a significant analgesic effect of carprofen. Plasma concentrations of carprofen were not directly related to analgesia; maximum plasma concentration, the area under the curve to the last data point, and area under the first moment curve up to the last data point were all significantly higher in the dogs given carprofen postoperatively (<i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">P</i> &lt; 0.05, Mann-Whitney). It was concluded that preoperative administration of carprofen has a greater analgesic effect than postoperative administration in the early postoperative period in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Plasma levels of carprofen are not related to the degree of analgesia achieved. Carprofen provides effective analgesia after canine ovariohysterectomy. The timing of analgesic administration is important to optimize the control of postoperative pain.

20163248395	Journal article	Effects of concurrent perioperative use of marbofloxacin and cimicoxib or carprofen in dogs.			Weil, C.; Tünsmeyer, J.; Tipold, A.; Hoppe, S.; Beyerbach, M.; Pankow, W. R.; Kästner, S. B.			Journal of Small Animal Practice		0022-4510	57	6	311-317	10.1111/jsap.12464	Wiley-Blackwell		2016	Oxford	UK	English		Objectives: To investigate possible interactions visible on electroencephalogram recordings caused by concomitant administration of marbofloxacin and carprofen or cimicoxib in dogs without central nervous system disease. Methods: Totally 21 client-owned dogs undergoing different surgeries were included in a randomised, blinded, clinical study. Each dog was assigned to one of two groups treated with either carprofen or cimicoxib pre- and postoperatively. After anaesthetic induction both groups received marbofloxacin intravenously while recording an electroencephalogram. Offline electroencephalogram analysis included qualitative evaluation and Fast Fourier Transformation. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated for 24 hours and after 10 days with the short-form Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale. Statistical analysis included Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann-Whitney U test and Student's <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">t</i>-test with α set at 5%. Results: Marbofloxacin injection caused no effects on quantitative and qualitative electroencephalogram parameters in both groups. No differences in postoperative pain scoring were found between treatment groups. Clinical Significance: Concurrent use of marbofloxacin with either cimicoxib or carprofen did not induce neuroexcitatory activities in dogs without CNS disease directly after administration.
